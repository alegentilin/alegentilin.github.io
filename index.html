            <h2>Summary of Personal Experience</h2>
            <p>I am a hybrid professional with expertise in both university and industry settings, focusing on the management and advisory of clinical and experimental scientific research, particularly in the fields of physiology and cardiovascular medicine. This is connected with in-depth experience in data engineering, applied artificial intelligence, electronics, and software development. </p>
            <li>	Scientific research management. Over the past 5 years, I have independently conceived and managed more than 25 research projects focused on topics related to human physiology, cardiovascular medicine and the development of medical technology. I have gained expertise across all stages of biomedical research, encompassing regulatory, scientific, and methodological dimensions. This includes crafting research protocols in compliance with regulatory frameworks and ethical standards, patient recruitment and assessment, laboratory test management, data assessment, and scientific and medical writing. I first-authored 12 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals in the last two years, and serve as a scientific advisor for various scientific journals and committees within the fields of physiology and cardiovascular medicine. The top 5 biomedical research techniques I am proficient in include Doppler Echocardiography, Vascular Doppler Ultrasound, cardio-impedance hemodynamics assessment, optical approaches (spectroscopy), and gas exchange measurement for assessing cardiopulmonary function. I have taught university courses in Human Anatomy and Physiology in Italy and Canada, supervised MSc students, and mentored over 30 interns in physiology over the past 5 years.</li>
            <li>	
                Data engineering and advanced statistics. I own extensive experience in these domains, complemented by my coding skills across various programs. I have a strong proficiency in statistics and biostatistics applied to scientific research contexts and research project management. I have experience in data processing and mathematical modeling for research and the development of industrial applications, particularly in the biomedical field. These include, but are not limited to, the use of advanced techniques for data mining, signal processing, feature extraction and selection, data prediction through regression models with machine learning, deep learning classification, and image processing.</li>
 <li>	
     Software development. I have been engaged in software development for approximately 20 years, with a specific focus on data science and engineering applications, as well as microprocessor programming. Furthermore, I have experience in developing software for the biomedical sector, particularly in the field of image processing and algorithm development. I own advanced knowledge of MATLAB, good proficiency in R and Python, and a foundational competence in C and Java.</li>
 <li>	
     Artificial intelligence-based technology and algorithm development. My skills in data engineering and software development complement this expertise, particularly concerning the development of medical technology and early disease detection algorithms. This encompasses not only the design of estimation algorithms, starting from data collection, mathematical modeling, and algorithm creation, but also the technological design of systems capable of hosting such algorithms. Therefore, this entails the design of embeddable algorithms, data transmission to external processing systems, and system interfacing.</li>
