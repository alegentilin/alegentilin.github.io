            <h2>Summary of Personal Experience</h2>
            <p>I am a hybrid professional with expertise in both university and industry settings, focusing on the management and advisory of clinical and experimental scientific research, particularly in the fields of physiology and cardiovascular medicine. My top 5 skills are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
           
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Scientific research management: Over the past 5 years, I have spearheaded 25+ research projects in human physiology, cardiovascular medicine, and medical technology. My expertise spans the regulatory, scientific, and methodological facets of biomedical research in both academia and industry. I actively contribute as a scientist and scientific advisor to journals and committees within the realms of physiology and cardiovascular medicine. Proficient in state-of-the-art biomedical techniques such as Doppler Echocardiography, Vascular Doppler Ultrasound, cardio-impedance hemodynamics, optical spectroscopy, and gas exchange measurement, I possess an advanced level of expertise in the comprehensive assessment of cardiocirculatory and cardiopulmonary functions, along with a strong track record in pioneering technology for these evaluations, applicable in medical and sports contexts.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Data engineering and advanced statistics: I own extensive experience in these domains, complemented by my coding skills across various programs. I have a strong proficiency in statistics and biostatistics applied to scientific research contexts and research project management. I have experience in data processing and mathematical modeling for research and the development of industrial applications, particularly in the biomedical field. These include, but are not limited to, the use of advanced techniques for data mining, signal processing, feature extraction and selection, data prediction through regression models with machine learning, deep learning classification, and image processing.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Software development. I have been involved in electronics and software development for approximately 20 years, with a specific focus on the development of microprocessor-based electronic systems. I have experience in developing software for the biomedical sector, particularly in the field of image processing and algorithm development. I possess advanced knowledge of MATLAB, proficiency in R and Python, and foundational competence in C and Java.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Artificial intelligence-based technology and algorithm development: My skills in data engineering and software development complement this expertise, particularly in the realm of medical technology and early disease detection algorithms. This includes not only designing estimation algorithms, starting from data collection, mathematical modeling, and algorithm creation, but also the technological design of systems capable of hosting such algorithms. This involves the design of embeddable algorithms, data transmission to external processing systems, and system interfacing. However, I also develop applications for other industrial contexts, particularly in Industry 4.0 applications, in settings related to process automation to be applied in electronic, mechanical, and electromechanical sectors.</li>
